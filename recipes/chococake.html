        <li>
            ½ cup vegetable oil
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup boiling water
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frosting</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>5 ⅓ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.
        </li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
             Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
            Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth 
            spreading consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, 
            then stack them onto a serving plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy!
        </li>
